# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
1	Overview of the analysis:
	◦	The purpose of this analysis is to provide Bobby and his managers a clean database set that includes the number of retiring employees per title, and the employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. This is to help the company prepare for the “silver tsunami” of retiring employees in the company. By having this data, the company will be able to get the number and job titles that will have to be replaced once employees start to retire. This data will help the company prevent having jobs that are not filled in a timely manner when the employees retire.

	2	Results:
	◦	There are 90,398 employees that will be retiring from Pewlett Hackard. 
	◦	Almost 1/3 of all employees at Pewlett Hackard will be retiring and there are not enough employees to represent the mentees in the mentorship 			program

	3	Summary:
